# [r/Tekken](https://www.reddit.com/r/Tekken/) Bot

Python bot to -

- update the livestream widget for [r/Tekken](https://www.reddit.com/r/Tekken/)
- ~~delete shitposts posted on days other than Shitpost Sunday~~
- implement the dojo system for [r/Tekken](https://www.reddit.com/r/Tekken/)

Updating the sidebar only works on the redesign. The job of porting it to old Reddit is not
currently being undertaken.

Based on [r/DotA2](https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2)'s [sidebar-bot](https://github.com/redditdota/sidebar-bot).
Many thanks to [u/coronaria](https://www.reddit.com/user/coronaria) for pointing me to the source.
